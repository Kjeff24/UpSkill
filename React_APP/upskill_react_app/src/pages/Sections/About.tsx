            <p>
              UpSkill was born from a desire to give educators a way to create
              quality education experiences over the internet. From its humble
              beginnings in 2023, UpSkill has constantly evolved through our
              commitment to pedagogy, open source philosophy, and a
              collaborative global community of like-minded educators and
              technologists.
